      For more than 20 years, FRP composites have been used in bridge
      applications, and they’ve met and exceeded all performance and safety
      standards set by the Association of State Highway and Transportation
      Officials. But, when it comes to composite bridge decking, many
      transportation departments across the country are unfamiliar with the
      technology. The transportation market sector has huge growth potential as
      per the recent survey of Lucintel and ACMA
