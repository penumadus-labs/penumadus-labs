//PROTOCOL DEFINITION

/*Global Parameters
  Every msg in socket to database is HSOCKETLEN bytes long
  Rationale: 
  1. We need to know how much to read from socket and
     the overhead in system calls to get len and reread
     with associated possibility of blocking and losing control
     when handling variable length data packets is usually greater
     than overhead of properly moving a few extra bytes in user space.
     This number should be tuned to just a couple bytes larger than largest
     Expected command/response
  
  2. Small len single writes in linux are guaranteed to be atomic at the process level
     so multiple writers on socket won't scramble command.
  
  3. Handling the message fragmentation problem on variable length messages introduces
     a lot of opportunity for coding errors and is easily added 
     to stable software in future if requred.
  
  4. We are communicating with multiple different unknown environments (nodejs, c, ....)
     so options like SOCK_SEQPACKET on the socket creation which are elegant albeit little
     known solutions to this problem are not available to us as they are incompatible with
     existing "web based" applicaton software stacks

/*PROTOCOL:
   Things headed downstream need to be terse for poor little hanks slow 
   baby brain and tiny memory.  
   Upstream on the server can be wordy.

   **(ABANDONED) arduino restrictions force jumptables into RAM which we have little of so
     this is done with a simple switch which stays in FLASH.  don't go down this road again
   On Downstream,  the commandbyte actually represents an offset into a jump 
   table down on hank to streamline parsing so keeping this file
   in sync is CRITICAL.  
  
   while a string based protocol would fix this linkage,
   hank doesn't even have the memory left over to store the string much less the horsepower
   to parse it and still get samples out.  
   In addition,  comms to hank are serial in current hardware.  each character takes us
   .2 mS to transmit/process.  When trying to hit a 5mS data sample rate,  just processing a
   a 10 character packet will use up 2mS of our 5mS window.  keep it terse. hank is predominantly
   an outgoing box. 
  
   hank max rate:                           5 KB/sec
   internet average rate:              20,000 KB/sec 
   server internal TCP/sock rate: 64,000,0000 KB/sec (measured on rpi)
   so if we can scarifice server time and complexity 
   to save hank time,  lets push processing up.
  
   **UPDATE got rid of pads to speed things up.  UDP holds packet boundaries for us
   no pad anymore
*/


/*IMPORTANT GLOBAL NOTE:
    all things heading to hank arrive with a prefix byte of WIFICMND (0xD0) or RECVDATA (0xB0)
    if they are from wifipi direct they have WIFICMND,  if they are pass through from UDPengine
    they have RECVDATA.   this is xbee serial protocol dictated

    following are sentences to be used transparent to prefix byte which is stripped by
    xbee or parser on hank
