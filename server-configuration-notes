# nginx

nginx is the entry point of the server listening on port 80 & 443
a config file "https.conf" contains https configuration and a reverse proxy to port 8000 where the main application listens
the path of this file is:
/etc/nginx/conf.d/https.conf

nginx uses certbot for its https certs
to re-certify run "sudo certbot --nginx"
certbot should renew automatically

# mongo database
