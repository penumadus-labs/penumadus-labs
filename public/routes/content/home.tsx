    <h1>Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer Smart Composite Bridge Deck</h1>
    <p>
      A demonstration of FRP -- modular solution for the future of road
      infrastructure
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiber reinforced polymer vehicular bridges and its components are a
      sustainable solution to the nation’s crumbling infrastructure
    </p>
    <p>
      With built in sensors, this “smart” bridge can be monitored throughout its
      lifecycle to ensure stability and performance
    </p>
    <p>
      This privately funded infrastructure is project aimed at demonstrating
      fiber-reinforced-polymer composite materials, or FRPs, as a fast and easy
      sustainable solution for improving the thousands of structurally deficient
      rural bridges that plague financially strapped counties across the U.S.
    </p>

    <h1>Why FRP?</h1>
    <p>150,000 US Bridges are Structurally Deficient or Obsolete</p>
    <p>Many Bridges can be RESTORED rather than REPLACED</p>
    <p>Composite Bridge Deck Technology</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proven Technology (100+ Pilot Projects Complete)</li>
      <li>Restoration vs High Cost Replacement</li>
      <li>Lower Life Cycle Cost for New Bridges</li>
      <li>Installation in Days, Better Survivability</li>
      <li>Costs have Limited the Market Penetration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>New Low Cost High Performance Composites</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SBIR Technology “Bridges” the Price and Performance Gap</li>
      <li>Co-Cure Allows Technology to apply to New Construction</li>
    </ul>

      “The full scale, prototype FRP deck panels performed exceptionally during
      all phases of testing. In general, results of the study indicated that the
      panels significantly exceeded the code required design forces in all
      instances. In flexure, shear and bearing, the average failure load
      exceeded the AASHTO Design Truck factored wheel load by nearly three
      times. Even more importantly, the panels behaved linearly-elastically
      throughout the full range of loading and possessed significant
      post-buckling strength. ” – MISSOURI DOT (JUNE, 2017)

    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      The University of Tennessee and the Institute for Advanced Composites
      Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) has partnered with Morgan County, TN and
      Morgan County Highway Superintendent Joe Miller to create an affordable
      bridge that can be installed quickly and will safely meet transportation
      needs
    </p>
    <p>
      Morgan County will now be home to a low-cost, low-maintenance,
      technologically advanced composites bridge deck system with a 100-year
      lifespan
    </p>
    <p>
      Located one-hour northwest of Knoxville on Elizabeth Church Road, Miller
      said the two-lane bridge has needed repair for many years, with rainstorms
      causing the road to flood to the point of being impassable
