 *         FREELISTLOWWATER is good between 2 and 4 or higher but must be <(FREELISTHIGHWATER-2)
 *         FREELISTHIGHWATER must be <(TOTALELEMENTS-BACKSAMPLES)-1 but .8 of this is recommended
 *		this is because accel ties up BACKSAMPLES of the buffers so we only have 
 *		the remainder to operate with
 *	   FWDSAMPLES can be whatever you want as they queue and send as obtained but
 *              be aware this slows things down if the queue gets full and have to start
 *              queuing to SD in real time.
