** todo

implement chart for bridge environmental data

add deviceType parameter to getDevices to filters types from the database

switch live mode to resolution/fixed number of packets (could maybe get user's device width)

store more settings in local_storage, maybe figure out how to encrypt local_storage

configure app with environment variables such as build mode etc

modify how app receives device dataField configurations


** bugs

figure out why staying on the environment tab but changes devices doesn't switch graphs

prevent page change on refresh

data fetch on live mode still not seeming to work properly

** test

all changes to tcp client are working properly
